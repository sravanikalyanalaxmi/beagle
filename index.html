            larger foxhound.The <b>beagle</b> was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as 
            beagling.Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the 
            <b>Beagle</b> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural
            imports and fiidstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <b>beagle</b> is intelligent
            and is a popular pet due to its size,good temper, and a lack of inherited health
